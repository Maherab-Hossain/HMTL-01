        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px; font-style: normal ;"  > Working with a boss is just a natural part of life. Whether you work a typical 
        <br> 9-5 desk job reporting to a manager, or you work as a freelancer reporting to 
        <br> clients, it’s important to understand how to work effectively with a boss.</p>
            

        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px; font-style: normal ;" >Today, we’ll help you identify different kinds of bosses and how to work with 
        <br> the type of boss you have (or might have in the future).</p>
               

            <b><h3 style="text-align: center ;font-style: normal;" >Boss Type #1: The Workaholic</h3></b>
               

        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px; font-style: normal ;" >A workaholic boss works long hours, sometimes during the weekends, and
         <br> seems to have endless energy.</p> 
                

        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px; font-style: normal ;" >It may take some extra effort to keep up with this kind of boss, but the 
        <br> payout can be worth it when you and your team reach goals far ahead of
        <br> schedule.</p>
                    

        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px; font-style: normal ;" >The key to keeping up with a workaholic boss is 
                 <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/01/work-life-balance-is-a-cycle-not-an-achievement" style="color: rgb(93, 202, 93);"> finding the perfect work-life 
        <br> balance.</a> You can achieve that by setting clear boundaries at work and at
        <br> home so the two don't interfere with one another in a detrimental way. Make 
        <br> sure to take natural breaks such as evenings, weekends, and holidays to 
        <br> rejuvenate, and then give 110% when you're at the office with your boss.</p>
                       

                    <b><h3 style="text-align: center ;" >Boss Type #2: The Traditionalist</h3></b>
                       

                    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px; font-style: normal ;" >If your boss tends to do things the way they’ve always been done, you might 
        <br> be working for a traditionalist boss.
        <br>

                     Under a traditionalist boss, you’ll learn some great time-tested methods of 
        <br> solving common problems.
        <br>


        <br> While you may need to work harder and more tactfully to think outside the
        <br> box, a traditionalist boss provides a very secure work environment where few 
        <br> risks are taken.
        <br></p>
                          

        <b><h3 style="text-align: center ;" >Boss Type #3: The Craftsman/Technician</h3></b>

        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px; font-style: normal ;" >
                    Sometimes a coworker or colleague may get promoted to work as your boss.
        <br> This type of boss is typically a craftsman or technician—meaning they’re 
        <br> really good at accomplishing the tasks assigned to your team.
        <br>

        <br> To work with this type of boss, be patient as they learn how to manage 
        <br> people in addition to being very talented at their craft. Then soak in the 
        <br> expertise and experience this boss can offer.
                    </p>


                    <b><h3 style="text-align: center ;" >Boss Type #4: The Micromanager</h3></b>

                    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px; font-style: normal ;" >
                            If your boss constantly follows up on every little piece of your project, you 
        <br> might be working for a micromanager.
        <br>

        <br>And while micromanagement has a lot of negative connotations, sometimes
        <br> it’s comforting knowing someone has your back and is watching each step as 
        <br> you go.
        <br>

        <br>To work with a micromanager, be proactive in reporting status updates, 
        <br> milestones, or other details even before they ask.
                    </p>

                    <b><h3 style="text-align: center ;" >Boss Type #5: The Goal-Setter</h3></b>


                    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px; font-style: normal ;" >
                            Many bosses are driven by goals either set by themselves or their superiors.
        <br> If you work with a goal-setting boss, focus your work around the goals they
        <br> care most about.
        <br>

        <br>When you give progress updates, make sure they’re reported in relation to 
        <br> the goals your boss and your team have identified as important.</p>

                    <b><h3 style="text-align: center ;" >Boss Type #6: The Alpha</h3></b>

        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px; font-style: normal ;" >
                                Some bosses are promoted to their management position because they’re
        <br> naturally a leader. These are Alpha bosses, and they possess special 
        <br> character traits that often make them uniquely qualified to lead a team.
        <br>
        <br>To work with an alpha boss, respect their leadership and soak in everything 
        <br>  they’re willing to teach you. The more you become part of “the
        <br>  pack,” the more they’ll take you under their wing.</p>
                                

                <b><h3 style="text-align: center ;" >Boss Type #7: The Detail-Focused</h3></b>

                <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px; font-style: normal ;" >
                If you have a boss who gets caught up in the smallest of details, you probably
        <br> have a detail-focused boss.
        <br>


        <br>To work with a boss who cares about the little details, take extra time to
        <br> polish up a presentation or add a little extra something special to a project.
        <br>  They’ll notice.</p>
                                    

                <b><h3 style="text-align: center ;" >Boss Type #8: “All About the Numbers”</h3></b>

                <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px; font-style: normal ;" >
                    Some bosses care about “the numbers” more than anything. These numbers 
        <br> might include sales, impressions, days without injury, or any number of
        <br> important metrics.
        <br>

        <br>To work well with a numbers-focused boss, identify which numbers they care
        <br> about, and then focus your daily work to contribute to the improvement of 
        <br> those numbers.</p>


                <b><h3 style="text-align: center ;" >Boss Type #9: The Busy Beaver</h3></b>

                <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px; font-style: normal ;" >
                Busy Beaver bosses are always preoccupied with some project, meeting, 
        <br> initiative, or report. This can be a good thing for employees who are more 
        <br> autonomous, leaving you with time to move forward on your important projects.
        <br>

        <br> To work with a busy beaver, don’t plan on “popping in” their office for a 
        <br> meeting. Set time on their calendar and come prepared to have an efficient 
        <br> and effective meeting.</p>

                <b><h3 style="text-align: center ;" >Boss Type #10: The Quiet Type</h3></b>

                <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px; font-style: normal ;">
                Finally, we’ve got the quiet boss. Some bosses prefer to just keep their heads
        <br> down and get the work done—which can be a blessing if you’re not the social 
        <br> type.
        <br>
        <br>To work with a quiet boss, you may need to ask for specific feedback and 
        <br>    learn to communicate asynchronously through email, Slack, or other means.</p>

                <b><h3 style="text-align: center ;" >What Type of Boss Do You Have?</h3></b>

                <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px; font-style: normal ;" >
                There are many more types of bosses out there, and working with each kind
        <br> is a fun and exciting challenge.
        <br>
        <br>Do your best to identify how your boss works and make plans to 
        <br> smoothly with them on a daily basis. If you need further assistance, consider
